                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Sleepy Hollow had a cafe and tavern called Ichabod's that later became a store and gas station (now known as Canyon Market) and there was another grocery store at the far eastern end of the community later. Other interesting historical features included the volunteer fire house and community center, now replaced by a modern community center built in the early 2000s, and the community church, which is now a private residence.</p>
