            <h3>Castle Shannon, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The first families settled Castle Shannon in 1786 in pursuit of farmland and timber and is widely assumed to be the Haas family. The most prominent farm was owned by David Strawbridge. Following common practices of Irish settlers—primarily from Ulster—in the region to name places and farms after former or ancestral homes in Ireland, he named it Castle Shanahan. Castleshanaghan is a townland in County Donegal, Ireland. Over time, the farm would lend its name to the area, as 'Shanahan' would evolve into 'Shannon'. In 1872, the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad line was completed, providing a direct link from Pittsburgh to the then-village of Castle Shannon. Development was stimulated by two years of free transportation and lumber transport given to anybody building a home.</p>
