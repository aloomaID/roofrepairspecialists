            <h3>Gananda, NY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Gananda was one of thirteen planned communities receiving federal guaranty assistance from HUD as part of their New Communities Program, created under the authority of the National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970. The original city of Gananda was to have occupied a total of 10,500 acres (42 km2) and have an expected population of over 90,000 after 30 years. The city would have had approximately 17,000 houses, 12 neighborhood centers, 1 major regional shopping center, 3 smaller shopping centers and a system of recreational facilities containing swimming pools, playgrounds and open space for parks and buffer spaces between housing known as 'Forever Wild'. The state of New York created an all-new school district for the planned city, Gananda Central School District which had the unique ability to lease school facilities allowing for normal educational usage during school hours and community usage after hours. Today, the Gananda Central School District continues to serve approximately 1,200 students.</p>
