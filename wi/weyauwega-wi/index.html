            <h3>Weyauwega, WI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Weyauwega is a city in Waupaca County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,900 at the 2010 census. The city is located mostly within the Town of Weyauwega, though it is politically independent of the town. Small portions extend north into the adjacent Town of Royalton. The city is commonly referred to as 'Wega' by local residents. The name 'Weyauwega' (/waɪ.əˈwiːɡə/ wy-ə-WEE-gə) is described by the Weyauwega Chamber of Commerce as potentially meaning 'Here we rest' in a local indigenous language because the town's origin was a stopping/resting point between two rivers when Native Americans had to portage their canoes. Given the local indigenous culture is described as Menominee the language may be the Menominee language if this etymology for Weyauwega is correct.</p>
